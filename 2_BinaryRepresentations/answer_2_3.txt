two's complement

start with the positive binary number
invert all the bits
add 1 to the entire inverted number and IGNORE overflow
the highest order bit is the sign bit 1 => negative number

127 ->  01111111
-128 -> 10000000
-1 ->   11111111 
1 ->    00000001
-14 ->  11110010


8-bit two's complement to decimal:
Remember highest order bit is negative. so the 8th bit (index 7) is -128
10000011 -> -125
11000100 -> -60
